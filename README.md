# Remote Rehabilitation of Patients with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and Motor Impairment 

## Synopsis

Motor impairment and Post-traumatic Stress Disability are two major effects of a physical and mental trauma
caused by accident and injuries. In a world where road accidents and fatal injuries are leading causes of
disability and impairment, there is a growing need of continuous, patient-centric and feasible rehabilitation
system. The present mechanism of treatment for patients with these problems requires frequent visits to
hospitals or patient care centres. Also, the treatment generally include therapies and regular monitoring by a
specialised doctor and an attendant, that is a challenge in places with poor ratio of number of patients per
doctor. In this paper, we analyse the present state-of-art healthcare industry with respect to the services
provided to patients and propose a solution to the problem of rehabilitation of patients by using an IoT based,
cost-effective, personalised remote monitoring and guidance system. The developed system can be installed
and used easily by patients and can keep track of the course of treatments and other important information as
required by the supervising doctor. 

## Motivation

The project was developed as a part of unique research-oriented hackathon organized bt [TEAMC18](http://teamc18.com/#) conference team. The hackathon was divided in phases starting from trekking to a particular place of interest, heathcare/hospitals in our case. Submitting a report based on trk formulating the problems in the healthcare industry and possible solution. This code is teh part of teh solution whivh was developed in 24 hours in teh hackathon held on 10-11 Feb 2018 at NSIT-NewDelhi.
